simplehbase
===========
Simplehbase is a lightweight middleware between java app and hbase.

The main feature of it are following:</br>
	data type mapping: mapping java type to hbase's bytes back and forth.</br>
	hbase operation wrapping: warpping hbase's put get scan operation to simple java interface.</br>
	hbase query language: using hbase filter, simplehbase can use sql-like style to operate on hbase.</br>
	dynamic query: like myibatis, simplehbase can use xml config file to define dynamic query to operate on hbase.</br>
