simplehbase
===========
Simplehbase is a lightweight middleware between java app and hbase.

The main feature of it are following:
	data type mapping: mapping java type to hbase's bytes back and forth.
	hbase operation wrapping: warpping hbase's put get scan operation to simple java interface.
	hbase query language: using hbase filter, simplehbase can use sql-like style to operate on hbase.
	dynamic query: like myibatis, simplehbase can use xml config file to define dynamic query to operate on hbase.
